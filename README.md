TASK 1
Initialization: number_of_starts = 10 initializes a variable named number_of_starts with the integer value 10.

Addition Assignment: number_of_starts += 5 is a shorthand for number_of_starts = number_of_starts + 5. It adds 5 to the current value of number_of_starts (which is 10) and assigns the result (15) back to the variable.

Subtraction Assignment: number_of_starts -= 3 is equivalent to number_of_starts = number_of_starts - 3. It subtracts 3 from the current value of number_of_starts (which is 15) and updates the variable to 12.

Multiplication Assignment: number_of_starts *= 2 is the same as number_of_starts = number_of_starts * 2. It multiplies the current value of number_of_starts (which is 12) by 2, resulting in 24.

Division Assignment: number_of_starts /= 4 is shorthand for number_of_starts = number_of_starts / 4. It divides the current value of number_of_starts (which is 24) by 4, resulting in 6.0 (note that division usually results in a float).

Output: print(number_of_starts) prints the final value of number_of_starts (which is 6.0) to the console.


TASK 2 
Initialization: Text = "Python" initializes a string variable named Text with the value "Python".

String Concatenation (and Assignment): Text += " Programming" is equivalent to Text = Text + " Programming". It concatenates (joins) the string " Programming" to the current value of Text (which is "Python") and assigns the combined string "Python Programming" back to the Text variable.

Output: print(Text) prints the final value of Text (which is "Python Programming") to the console.
